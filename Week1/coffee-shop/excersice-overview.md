1. Coffee Shop: Exercise Overview
   As you begin your web development journey, a digital agency has brought you on as a developer intern. They are looking to help you learn and grow, and want your help on a simple client project. In this scenario, the client is a new local coffee shop set to launch soon. Before they open to the public, they’re looking to create a digital presence and drive awareness through the use of a website.

Specifically, your task will be to build a multi-page website for them. To assist you in the building process, the project has been segmented into 17 individual exercises to focus on core concepts from lectures.

Equipped with all of the necessary design resources (provided to you as needed), your task is to build upon and complete all daily exercises. It is important that you complete all the Coffee Shop exercises given the incremental progression of this project and the need to submit your work as seen below.

The project is broken down into two main pages: a Landing Page, and a Menu. The Landing Page is the main page for the site and is where visitors can access basic information. The menu page will provide further details about the coffee shop’s offerings.

Submission
You will have two deliverables for the Coffee Shop website website as outlined in the Synapse Projects tab.

The two required submissions can be done through the Synapse Projects tab.

Starter Code
Download the following folder.Inside are folders to store your work from each day. There are basic files for each of our main pages (the Landing Page and Menu). Please complete the first exercise using those documents as they contain the starting code necessary for the project.

Saving your work
Before proceeding with your new exercises, it’s recommended that you make a copy of the HTML and CSS files from the previous exercise. This will give you a reference point to work from and eliminate the need for you to redo all of the previous exercises if you make a mistake.

Next Steps
As the project develops, you’ll be provided with updated resources as necessary to ensure that the exercise's requirements can be met. These resources specifically include the following:

Style Guides: These documents explain how to implement visual styling as part of the project (e.g. size of images, colors needed, etc.). Style guides are versioned documents, meaning that relevant details are progressively added as necessary considering how the project develops and changes over time.
Mockups: These documents are PDFs that provide a reference to what your work should look like for a given part of the project. New mockups will be provided as necessary to serve as a reference for the development of the project.
With the project now introduced, you can dive into today’s exercises.
