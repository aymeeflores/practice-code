4. Coffee Shop: Landing Page HTML Structure
   With the fundamental components of the menu now created, let’s turn our attention to developing the other component of the site: the landing page.

Using the existing index.html file in the ‘Day 1’ folder and the mockup provided, ensure your landing page has the following structure. Note that there are mentions of adding image tags below. For now, let’s specify the alt text for each image, and leave the URL or src attribute portion blank. We’ll focus on adding these images in a future exercise.

Header & Navigation
The header must include:

The navigation bar
A level one heading stating "Nitro Coffee"
A paragraph tag with the coffee definition
A button stating "SHOP NOW"
An empty image tag with the alt text “coffee bag”
The navigation bar must include:

An empty image tag with the alt text coffee bean logo
A level two heading stating "nitro"
An unordered list
Each item must use an anchor tag
Our Products Section
The "Our Products" section must include:

A card for each product (Coffee Beans, Cold Brew, In-house Brew)
Each card will contain:
An empty image tag with the alt text for each product
A level three heading with the product name
A paragraph tag with the price of the product
A button stating "VIEW ALL"
Discount Section
The discount section must include:

A paragraph stating "Get 20% off your first order with code: FirstNitro"

Paragraph tags with the address information
An “Hours” division. This division will contain:

A “Social division.” This division will contain:

An empty image tag with the alt text for each social icon (Facebook, Yelp, Instagram)
For all the landing page's content, reference the mockup provided.

Remember, when building your HTML structure, be sure to use semantic tags where necessary.

Note: Do not style your HTML document with any CSS, simply build the structure. Upcoming exercises will provide details on how to style your landing page.
