As mentioned in the project overview, this project consists of two pages: a Landing Page, and a Menu. Letâ€™s start with the Menu page.

Seeing as computers are at the heart of a website, your task is to develop a menu that both customers and machines can understand. Using the syntax and semantics for a markup language, create a menu that communicates the options available for customers to order. These options are organized into the following categories:

Hot drinks
Cold drinks
Pastries
Using the list of available items below, open the text file in your code editor. Structure your markup document to effectively communicate all information in a meaningful way. Feel free to download a text file of the items listed below here.
