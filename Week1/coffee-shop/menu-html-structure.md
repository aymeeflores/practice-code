3. Coffee Shop: Menu HTML Structure
   With your menu now structured in markup, it’s time to iterate on your work and prepare it to be ready for the internet. Your task is to convert your markup menu into the markup language of the web: HTML.

Please use the menu.html file found in the ‘Day 1’ folder to complete this exercise. Copy and paste your original markup work into the menu HTML file. Your menu should meet the following requirements:

Use a level one heading
Have a navigation bar
Use an unordered list for your navigation links
Each navigation link should use an anchor tag
Use a level two heading to define each section of the menu
Each item should:
Have a level three heading for the name of the item
Use a paragraph tag to display the description and price
Be sure to properly use semantic tags. If you recall, some semantic tags include:

<header>
<nav>
<main>
<section>
<footer>
Use the following mockup as a reference to ensure you have properly structured your HTML document.

Note: Do not style your HTML document with any CSS, simply build the structure. Upcoming exercises will provide details on how to style your menu.
