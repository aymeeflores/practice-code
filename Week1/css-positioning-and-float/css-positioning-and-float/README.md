# CSS Positioning and Floats

## To Do

- [x] Go over what we have
- [ ] Go over static positioning \*\*\*
  - All HTML elements default to position: static.
  - I can't seem to apply CSS properties such as `top` or `left`, etc.
- [ ] Go over absolute positioning \*\*\*
- [ ] Go over relative positioning \*\*\*
- [ ] Go over fixed positioning \*\*
- [ ] Go over sticky positioning \*

> Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned.

- [ ] Go over floats \*\*
- [ ] Go over clear fixes \*
