# CSS Typography and Font Face

- [ ] How `font-family` works (must know)
- [ ] Using locally installed fonts (should know, especially for your assignment)
- [ ] Google Fonts (used in assignment) - use a pair from [fontpair](https://fontpair.co/) or [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/)
- [ ] Custom fonts, [using Transfonter](https://transfonter.org/).
  - Note: I got the Naftera font from [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/).
- [ ] Font icons such as [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) or [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/) (nice to know)
- [ ] Other neat typographic CSS properties like `letter-spacing` and `line-height` (nice to know)
