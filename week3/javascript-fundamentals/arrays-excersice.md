Exercise: Arrays
In this exercise, we will use the task of grocery shopping to put your new knowledge of arrays to use. By the end of the exercise you should know how to:

Create arrays and assign them to variables
Add a new value to an array
Access values in an array
Get the length of an Array
Requirements
Create Our Shopping List
It's your turn to get the groceries and your roommate told you quickly over the phone what you need to pick up. Problem is you don't have an official list. Let's make one:

First, create a variable called groceryList and make its value an array

Hard code the following three items into your array:

Apples
Oranges
Cereal
Hint: What datatype should each item be?

Shopping For An Item
Now we want to access an item from our groceryList. Using your knowledge of array indexing, do the following:

Print the first and last item in our groceryList
When printing the last item from our list, you must index the list as if you do not know how many items are on our list.
Adding To Our Shopping List
Your roommate just realized that the two of you have an emergency- there is no more toilet paper! Time to add that item to our list:

You must use a method to add an item to the array:
Note: You can not just create a new array with the updated list.
Once the item has been added, console.log the groceryList, to see your now updated array.
Payment
Your roommate wants to pay for half of the items you picked up. He wants to know how many items are in your list so he can do the math.

Using the appropriate method / syntax, determine the number of items in our groceryList
Using that number, print in the console a message telling your roommate how many items are on our list.
