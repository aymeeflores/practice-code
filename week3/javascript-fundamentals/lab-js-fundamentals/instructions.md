Getting Started
Download index.html and script.js.
Open up index.html in VSCode and note the <script> tag.
When you open up index.html in the browser it will execute your script.js file!

Write each of your lab exercises on different lines.
Feel free to leave empty lines between your exercises.
Write comments to describe the exercises.
Open index.html in the browser.
Right-click and select inspect to open up the Chrome inspector.
Click the Console tab.
If your code has any errors, messages will show up here.
The line of your error can be found on the right of the message.
Exercises
For each exercise in which you assign a value to a variable, you must alert() it to see the value in the browser or console.log() it to see it in the console.

// example
var value = 8; // your exercise gets assigned to a variable
console.log(value); // your exercise result is displayed in the console
alert(value); // your exercise result is displayed in a popup in the browser
Write a statement that adds the numbers 3 and 5 and stores it in a variable.
Create two string variables, one containing your first name and the other containing your last name. Concatenate them to display your full name.
Create two boolean variables (one true and one false). OR (||) and AND (&&) the variables together then inspect the result.
In one line, add 3 and 5 together and then multiply the result by 11.
