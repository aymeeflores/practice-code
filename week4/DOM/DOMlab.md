Lab: DOM
Overview
In this exercise, we will be writing JavaScript that will be executed when a page loads. This particular code will help in changing the appearance of our sample webpage. Understanding how to manipulate the DOM is critical when looking to build more professional and interactive web-pages.

Directions
Selecting Elements
Get the nav-bar element by its id and output the result with console.log
Which data type was returned?
Get the main element using the querySelector method and console.log the result
Which data type was returned?
Get a list of every <a> element using querySelectorAll
Which data type was returned?
Now try selecting the <a> tag with querySelector
What is the observed difference between querySelectorAll and querySelector?
Getting and Setting InnerHTML
Write the following code inside of a setTimeout call with a one second delay or 1000ms. This will allow you to see the state of the webpage before and after your code executes. If you haven't used setTimeout see this article for more information.

Get the Logo element and store it in a variable
console.log the innerHTML property of the element
Assign a new value to the innerHTML property to change the Logo on the site
Setting Style on Multiple Elements
Write the following code inside of a setTimeout call with a one second delay, 1000ms. This will allow you to see the state of the webpage before and after your code executes.

Get a list of every <a> element using querySelectorAll again and store it in a variable
Use a for loop with the list to apply a new style to each element
Add the text-decoration: underline property to each element in the list
More Practice
Now that you know how to change HTML and the style of elements using JavaScript, try changing other elements on the page for example how would you change the text of the User from John Smith to be Your Name?
