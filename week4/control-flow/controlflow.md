Lab: Control Flow
Getting Started
In this lab you will be writing code in script.js, and running it by opening index.html in the browser and/or refreshing the page. Check your results (or errors) using the web inspector. To keep your lab more organized, you might consider putting each exercise inside its own function.

To begin, download the starter files here.

Conditionals
If/Else
Create a variable called time
Write an if/else block that...
Logs You're early! if time is less than 10
Logs You're on-time! if time is exactly 10
Logs You're late! for any other time
Create a variable called timeOfWeek
You can expect that it will either hold the value weekday or weekend
Modify your if/else block to only log the above messages if it is a weekday
Otherwise, log You shouldn't be in class!
Come up with at least three different times to test your code with and try them out
Switch
Create a variable called facialExpression
Write a switch statement that...
Logs You look happy if facialExpression is "smiling"
Logs You look sad if facialExpression is "frowning"
Logs You look angry if facialExpression is "scowl"
Logs I don't know for any other value
What happens when you forget to include break statements in each case?
Loops
For Loops
Create an array of strings called famousCats with at least three entries
You can use "garfield", "felix", "meowth"
Write a for loop that prints each cat to the console
Write a for loop that prints each cat except the first to the console
Write a for loop that prints each cat to the console in reverse order
While Loops
Rewrite the previous exercise using a while loop
Terminating a For Loop
Use your famousCats array from the previous exercise
Create a new variable called myFavourite that holds the name of your favorite famous cat
Write a for loop that...
Logs Kitty? if the current cat is not your favorite cat
Logs There you are! if the current cat is your favorite cat and then breaks the loop
Test your loop with some different arrays
Favorite last
Favorite first
Favorite not in array
Empty array
Terminating a While Loop
Rewrite the previous exercise using a while loop
Make sure that the loop terminates when...
Your favorite cat is found
The end of the array is reached
