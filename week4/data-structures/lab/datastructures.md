Lab: Data Structures
Overview
In this lab you will be writing code in the file script.js and running it by opening index.html in the browser or refreshing the page. Check your results (or errors) using the Chrome inspector.

To get started, please download the starter files here.

Instructions
Arrays
Create an array containing three strings in a single line

Use web development terms that you have learned so far for your string values
Use the literal syntax
console.log the array

console.log the first item in the array

console.log the last item in the array

What happens when you try to access an index that does not have an item?
Create the same array that you did in step 1, but this time start with an empty array and then push your strings

What is a return value of push operation?
console.log this array to confirm it is same as your literal array

pop and then console.log each of the items in this array

How many items are in the array now?
Use square bracket syntax to set the value of literal array at index 1 to a new string

console.log the array after setting the value of index 1
Now set a value at index 5 and console.log the resulting array. Observe what happens to values in indices between 3 and 5?
Remove all undefined values from literal array using the splice function

Objects
Create an object that contains three properties using the literal syntax

firstName
Your first name as a string
lastName
Your last name as a string
likesCoffee
A boolean indicating whether or not you like coffee
Create the same object, but this time start with an empty object and then add the properties

Have at least one example of dot-notation assigning and one example of square brackets assigning
console.log the firstName property of your object using dot-notation access

console.log the lastName property of your object using square brackets access

Add the console.log function to your object as a new property called speak

Use the speak property of your object to print the object's likesCoffee value to console

Create a variable named currentKey and set it’s value to ”firstName”. Using square bracket syntax and your new variable as a dynamic key, get a value of firstName of your object. Try changing the value of currentKey to lastName and likesCoffee to observe the dynamic functionality of using variables as keys

Add a new property to your object named areasOfExpertise and set the value to a literal array from Arrays exercise

console.log your object and inspect it using Chrome Dev Tools
