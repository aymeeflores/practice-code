React State
Introduction
In this exercise, we will create a carousel UI using React. It will require a good understanding of how state works in React components.

Instructions
Please download your starter code here.

Clicking either the "Previous" button or the "Next" button should change the displayed image
Total number of images and the index of current image should be displayed underneath
The navigation buttons must be disabled when there are no more images to display in that direction
Diving Deeper
How fast is your application? If you are using one img tag in your code, chances are there is a noticeable lag when changing from one image to another. Try to minimize this lag.

Hint: Rendering an image from scratch is quite slow.

Diving Even Deeper
Animate the transition between slide changes. (This is a very challenging task. Don't get discouraged if you find it difficult)
